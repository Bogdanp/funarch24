Deployment can be internet-based without a shared local network, or local-network-based even without internet access. For coding, Python is used, a popular, open-source programming language. www.oTree.org provides the source code, a library of standard game templates and demo games which can be played by anyone.},

We describe the implementation of the server and its use in the development of an application for managing conference paper reviews. In the process of developing this application, we encountered subtle forms of interaction not directly addressed by using continuations. We discuss these subtleties and offer solutions that have been successfully deployed in our application. Finally, we present some details on the server’s performance, which is comparable to that of the widely-used Apache Web server.},

	abstract = {Continuation-based Web servers provide distinct advantages over traditional Web application development: expressive power and modularity. This power leads to fewer errors and more interesting applications. Furthermore, these Web servers are more than prototypes; they are used in some real commercial applications. Unfortunately, they pay a heavy price for the additional power in the form of lack of scalability. We fix this key problem with a modular program transformation that produces scalable, continuation-based Web programs based on the REST architecture. Our programs use the same features as non-scalable, continuation-based Web programs, so we do not sacrifice expressive power for performance. In particular, we allow continuation marks in Web programs. Our system uses 10 percent (or less) of the memory required by previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Operators for delimiting control and for capturing composable continuations litter the landscape of theoretical programming language research. Numerous papers explain their advantages, how the operators explain each other (or don't), and other aspects of the operators' existence. Production programming languages, however, do not support these operators, partly because their relationship to existing and demonstrably useful constructs - such as exceptions and dynamic binding - remains relatively unexplored.
            In this paper, we report on our effort of translating the theory of delimited and composable control into a viable implementation for a production system. The report shows how this effort involved a substantial design element, including work with a formal model, as well as significant practical exploration and engineering.
            The resulting version of PLT Scheme incorporates the expressive combination of delimited and composable control alongside dynamic-wind, dynamic binding, and exception handling. None of the additional operators subvert the intended benefits of existing control operators, so that programmers can freely mix and match control operators.},

A continuation is a program-level manageable value representing the rest of the computation of the program. "What to do next" is precisely what has to be explicitly encoded in order to program non trivial web interactions. Continuations allow web applications to be written in direct style that is, as a single program that displays forms and reads form submission since continuations automatically capture everything (control point, lexical bindings, etc.) that is needed to resume the computation. Programming is therefore safer, easier and more re-usable.},
