 @t{Example study}
 ) ;; Marc: What does congame do?
; What type of study:
; - Provide name and favorite programming language
; - Display different messages depending on the programming language provided, and use the name to respond
; - Guess coin toss, so that it already prepares the ground for later.

(slide
 #:title @~a{Why Congame?}

 @t{The origin story:}

 ; Break these into gains from congame vs from continuations
 @item{Reusability and composability: example of not being able to reuse parts (Tasks5, Tasks10)}
 @item{Linking participants over time: manually linking studies over time}
 @item{Non-linear flow: not having to have hundreds of flags to decide whether a page should be displayed or not}
 @item{Using all features of programming language no matter where}
 @item{Easy (non-global) state management}
 @item{Sane data storage: scope etc});; Marc: Why is this useful/different/better than other software? Take from paper, but split into several points.
